# Pak-File-Emulator-ReloadedII
An emulator for Spike Chunsoft Pak Files

# How to use
Supply the vanilla .pak file in [the WAD File Emulator](https://github.com/morgana-x/Wad-File-Emulator-ReloadedII) wherever it belongs

Then create a new folder in FEmulator/PAK named after the pak file

Then put a named file that is named after it's index (eg 53.tga etc) (file extension is ignored)

Then the file at slot 53 should be replaced with your new one

Now you can edit the pak file without repacking it every 10 seconds!
